## 👶 Getting Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `moerphous-server` for local development.

1. Fork the `moerphous-server` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/moerphous-server.git
```
3. Create a virtualenv with make:

```sh
make venv
```

4. Activate the virtualenv:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install the main dependencies into the virtualenv using poetry and make. Assuming you have poetry installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development:

```sh
make install
```

**Note**: _This command will automatically generate a `.env` file from `.env.example`, uninstall the old version of poetry on your machine, then install latest version `1.2.2`, and install the required main dependencies._

6. Create a branch for local development:

```sh
git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

7. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass tox tests, including testing other Python versions with make:

```sh
make test-all
```

8. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

9. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## 📙 Pull Request Guidelines.

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests, if possible.
2. The pull request should work for Python 3.9.10. Check and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

## 💡 Tips.

To run a subset of tests:

```sh
make test
make lint
make coverage
```

Thank you for helping us improve!
